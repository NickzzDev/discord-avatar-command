# discord-avatar-command

This Command allows you to view your avatar, or other members avatars, by mentioning the user after you do the command! 

I will provide this command in v12, and v13, to suit majority of people out there!

In the description, i have put my credits in there, as i made this command myself. I would appreciate if you could keep the credits in there, as i made this command, and would appreciate it if you could. Thanks, and hope you enjoy!
